# An Adaptive Sampling Algorithm for the Top-K Group Betweenness Centrality
 This repository implements the Adaptive Sampling Algorithm in our paper "An Adaptive Sampling Algorithm for the Top-K Group Betweenness Centrality".
# Installation
 The algorithm is completed by c++, and the software requires *Microsoft Visual Studio 2023*.
# Running
 The folder `include` contains the header files supporting our algorithm and you can use `main.cpp` to run our algorithm.
